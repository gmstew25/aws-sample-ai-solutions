# =============================================================================
# Terraform Core Files to Ignore
# =============================================================================

# Local Terraform directories and cache
# This directory contains downloaded providers and modules. It's generated by `terraform init`.
.terraform/

# Terraform State Files
# CRITICAL: These files contain sensitive data in plain text and must NEVER be committed.
# Your state should be managed remotely using a backend (like the S3 backend you set up).
*.tfstate
*.tfstate.*

# Crash log files
crash.log
crash.*.log

# Exclude all .tfplan files
# These are build artifacts and can contain sensitive data.
*.tfplan

# =============================================================================
# Variable Files
# =============================================================================

# Ignore all .tfvars files to prevent accidentally committing sensitive variables.
# It's a best practice to create a `terraform.tfvars.example` file with placeholder
# values, commit that instead, and have each user create their own local .tfvars file.
# *.tfvars
*.tfvars.json

# Ignore override files, which are used for temporary local testing
*.tfoverride
*.override.tf
*.override.tf.json
*_override.tf
*_override.tf.json

# Terraform lock file
.terraform.lock.hcl
